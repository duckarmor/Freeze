# How does immutability help?

Immutable data structures cannot be changed once they have been created. This allows these data structures to forever hold their current state forever, __frozen in time__, as long as you have a reference to them.

That sounds cool, but what does that actually mean for programmers?

## Value Equality vs Reference Equality
First you'll want to have a simple understanding of the difference between __value equality__ and __reference equality__.

Let's take these two lists.
```lua
local list1 = { "a", "b", "c" }
local list2 = { "a", "b", "c" }
```
They look the same right? Are they equal?
```lua
print(list1 == list2)
-- false
```
Luau would seem to think not.

That is because the `==` operator compares two values by __reference equality__. `list1` and `list2` are represented by two different addresses in memory.

Try it out! Use `print` on `list1` and `list2` and you'll see they print two different --credit card numbers-- memory addresses.

```lua
print(tostring(list1))
-- table: 0x1111111111111111
print(tostring(list1))
-- table: 0x2222222222222222
```

If we wanted to compare the value equality between the two lists, that could become expensive depending on the size of the lists.

If we treated `list1` as an **immutable** list, we can solve this class of problems:

```lua
local list1 = { "a", "b", "c" }
local list2 = Freeze.List.set(list1, 4, "d")
```

Now we have two lists that we can compare against by __reference equality__ and if they differ we can assume they also differ via __value equality__.

----

Let's look at this example from another perspective and focus on `list1`.

```lua
local list1 = { "a", "b", "c" }
list[4] = "d"
```
`list1` has changed its __value equality__ but its reference is still the same. Wouldn't it be nice if we could have tracked the history of `list1`? Maybe we need to perform some action once `index 4` has been assigned.

## Ok, but what about practical applications?

In short, use of these data structures lead to simpler development time. In practical terms, React and Rodux rely on immutable data structures to detect if they should re-render or raise a changed event.

Take the following example from Rodux:

```lua
store.changed:connect(function(newState, oldState)
    -- newState and oldState are immutable "snapshots" of state
    if newState.todos ~= oldState.todos then
        print("something changed within our todos field!")
    end
end)
```
Since newState and oldState are two unique snapshots of state, they can be referenced now or at a later date to determine what has changed.

We didn't have to run an expensive value equality comparision function. Simply the basis of the reference equality (`==`) is all we need.

If newState and oldState were not immutable, we would have a much harder time determining something had changed.


## I can't stop reading about immutability!

If we haven't yet satiated your desires for literature about immutability, take a look at what these other authors have to say:
